# Introduction

Our vision was to demonstrate the amount of usage that students have on particular resources such as
iClickers, textbooks, and more; that can all be utilized by other students once the owner no longer
needs it. Hence, reusing/reselling school resources through an application as a marketplace that
connects the buyers and the sellers. Our goal is to prevent these useful items from being thrown in
the trash when it can be used and bought by someone else at an affordable price. We hope in years to
come that our product is a staple in SFU studentsâ€™ learning culture.

Introducing SFU TradeHub! Where students or faculty members will be able to browse for items that
other people do not find useful to them anymore.The SFU TradeHub allows students to put up products
(i.e. Books, iClickers, etc.) that they would not need anymore and sell them. Students will be able
to buy the items directly from the seller by contacting each other individually. The marketplace app
 will help promote the usage of reusing instead of throwing or recycling the items away.

The solution is to create a connected community at SFU that allows people to exchange school
materials through an app with listings of materials being sold that will be in use by another
student. Thus, a handy app: SFU TradeHub is created for being a marketplace that allows students to
interact, communicate, and browse through for buyers or sellers.
